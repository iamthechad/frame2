Building Frame2
----------------------------------------

Frame2 is built using the latest version of Ant
and Tomcat.

To prepare the build, create a file named override.properties
with the location of Tomcat on your system.
Running 'ant' at the top level will build the Frame2 jars, 
create JavaDoc, and run all tests that do not require an
application server. 

To run all tests, add the line 'run_container_tests=true' 
to override.properties. Run the 'ant war' target to create
a web application file named frame2.war. Deploy this 
application into Tomcat, and start Tomcat. Rerun the 
'ant' task with the overridden property to run all tests,
including tag related tests.

Automatic deployment of the test WAR is planned.
