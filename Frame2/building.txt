Building Frame2
----------------------------------------

Frame2 is built using the latest version of Ant
and Tomcat.

There are two source distributions; one that includes all 
required third party libraries, and one that contains only
Frame2 source code. If you have the distribution that does
not include the required libraries, they will need to be
downloaded and configured into the build system.


For Both Distributions:
Create a file named override.properties in the same directory
as build.xml. Add a property to this file named "tomcat-home"
that points to the location of Tomcat on your system.

Frame2 relies heavily on unit testing. By default, running
'ant' at the top level will build the Frame2 jars, 
create JavaDoc, and run all tests that do not require an
application server. 

To run the tests that require an app server, add the line 
'run_container_tests=true' to override.properties. Run the 
'ant war' target to create a web application file named 
frame2.war. Deploy this application into Tomcat, and start 
Tomcat. Rerun the 'ant' task with the overridden property 
to run all tests, including tag related tests.

(Automatic deployment of the test WAR is planned.)


Source Only Distribution:
In order to successfully build the framework, a number of third
party libraries are required. The following table explains these
libraries.
