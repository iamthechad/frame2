To build the samples, Ant is required.

Run the ant script from the samples directory. Running 'ant'
will create WAR files for each sample. Or, you can run ant 
for individual targets. 

Current samples that have targets are:
'ant build-blankwar' - Builds the blank application
'ant build-examplewar' - Builds the sample used in the Getting Started guide
'ant build-soapexamplewar' - Builds a sample that extends the example by adding support for adding users via web service calls.
'ant build-template-examplewar' - Builds the sample used in the Template Getting Started guide

Note that the soap example is not complete. A tutorial will be produced explaining how to build it - at that time the example will probably include a crude client for interacting with the web service.
