To build the samples, Ant is required.

Run the ant script from the samples directory. Running 'ant'
will create WAR files for each sample. Or, you can run ant 
for individual targets. 

Current samples that have targets are:
'ant build-blankwar' - Builds the blank application
'ant build-examplewar' - Builds the sample used in the Getting Started guide
