Some notes about using Frame2:

In its default configuration (i.e. using the blank web application),
Frame2 may behave strangely for certain actions. These configuration
items are detailed below.

1. File Uploading is disabled. In order to reduce the download size
and number of required libraries, file upload support is disabled
by default. To enable file upload support, download the latest
version of the Commons FileUpload component from Jakarta. Place the
JAR file into your web application's lib directory. It's that simple.
(Note that trying to submit a multipart form request when this library
is not present will result in a Frame2Exception being thrown. Of
course, your application is configured with an error handler to catch
these, right?)

2. Form validation is disabled. Once again, in order to reduce download
size and library count, the Commons Validation component is disabled by
default. Events can still be validated by implementing custom validation
methods. To enable Commons Validation support, download the latest version
from Jakarta. Place commons-validator.jar, commons-digester.jar,
commons-beanutils.jar, and jakarta-oro.jar into your web application's lib
directory.

3. Standard Java logging is enabled. By default, Frame2 uses the built in
logging facilities of Java 1.4. If you wish to use log4j, download it and
extract the jars into your web application's lib directory. Edit the web
application's web.xml file to update the type of logger that is being used.
