<h1>What is Frame2?</h1>
<p>
Frame2 is a second-generation implementation of the JSP Model 2 web application 
architecture.<br>
It builds on the prior art of frameworks such as Struts, WebMacro 
and Virtuas Solutions' TurboM2 Framework to present a highly configurable and 
modularized tool that supports the development of both web applications and web 
services using J2EE.<br>
Frame2 users (that is, developers who build  web 
applications and services) will use the Frame2 framework to integrate business 
assets with web-based user interfaces.<br>
With Frame2, business assets may be 
used as-is, with no modification. The user interface components (JSPs, HTML, 
images, etc.) are bundled with the framework, configuration information, 
and user extensions for deployment in the J2EE servlet container.
</p>
<h2>The Frame2 Development Model</h2>
Frame2 presents a standard layered/n-tier model for development. Each layer 
contains code and configuration data specific to its purpose. These layers are 
intended to keep application and service development simple, reliable and 
sustainable.<br>
The layers in the Frame2 model are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Client Presentation	- Presentation code that executes on the client. This 
generally corresponds to Javascript placed into the HTML response. Javascript 
may be used to perform lightweight validation or to implement dynamic 
presentation features.</li>
<li>Server Presentation	- Presentation code that executes on the server. This 
generally corresponds to JSP and custom tag code. Frame2 provides custom tags 
for seamlessly combining HTML with server data.</li>
<li>Application Controller - The controller acts as a mediator between the 
presentation layer and the application logic. Because the mapping of requests 
to application-specific logic and data lends itself to generic, data-driven 
implementations, the application controller is an ideal candidate for framework 
design. Packages such as Frame2 and Struts serve this role.</li>
<li>Application Logic - Application code that implements logic for the 
navigation and processing of user inputs (i.e. complicated validation or 
integrity checks). Application logic pertains to the behavior of the application 
with respect to user inputs.</li>
<li>Business Services or Model - Domain oriented data abstractions, services and 
models. These are separated from the application logic and have a high potential 
for reuse across different applications. They may be hosted in the same 
container as the application layers or hosted remotely.</li>
<li>Resource - Resources external to the application such as databases, 
messaging services, transaction managers, other remote facilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For web services, the layering corresponds to a similar model. The presentation 
layer is replaced with programmatic clients, which are often outside the realm 
of the service developer. Additionally application-level behaviors are 
simplified in comparison to web applications, often reduced to pass-through to 
the underlying business service.
</p>
Interposing an application controller between the client and application logic 
offers numerous advantages. Foremost is simplifying the work to develop web 
applications that have non-trivial navigation and processing rules. Complicated 
and rote programming tasks for managing the navigation rules, converting data 
from the HTTP requests, and data validation can be avoided through automation 
and configuration. Security measures can also be made uniform.
<h2>Configurability</h2>
Model 2 controllers intrinsically manage navigation concerns.<br>
Frame2 provides a rich set of configuration features that combine easily with 
user-provided application logic. Through the configuration, users can define 
mappings between the client requests and the application components that 
process those requests, and between the outcomes of the processing to the views.
<br>Within these configuration elements specification can be given to how to 
handle invalid inputs, cancellation requests, and errors generated by the 
application code of the framework itself.<br>
In support of co-hosting both web applications and web services in the same 
deployment, the configuration information can be segregated between the HTTP 
and the XML processing streams.
<h2>Web Application Support</h2>
Frame2 provides a number of features for web application support.<br>
At the server presentation layer it provides custom tags that extend the JSTL 
expression language to standard HTML tags as well as allowing 
internationalization without the need for learning or understanding new tag 
attributes.<br>
At the controller layer, Frame2 gives a simplified programming model for 
creating and structuring application data and logic. Frame2 automatically 
populates JavaBeans with data from the HTTP request, validates the data, and 
then provide the data to the appropriate handlers for execution of the 
application logic.<br>
To complement these features Frame2 interoperates with the J2EE security model 
to allow configurable role-based security for all requests made through the 
framework.
<h2>Web Service Support</h2>
Frame2 can be used with any JAX-RPC SOAP front-end (for example, Apache Axis or 
the Sun's JWSDP).<br>
The web service features give the user broad latitude in how the SOAP request 
body is structured as well as how the response is generated.<br>
Bodies may be processed as single or batch requests, with unmarshalling into 
JavaBeans automatically taken care of through JAXB technologies. Frame2 
interoperates with JAXB to allow XML schema definitions to be automatically 
converted and validated as JavaBeans.<br>
With a defined schema, developers can code application and business services 
without having to understand XML or SOAP; the code to the JavaBean 
representations of the SOAP bodies and Frame2 with JAXB manages conversion.
<h2>Simple API</h2>
Frame2 abstracts the transport and protocol layers to minimize the difficulty 
with learning and using complex technologies such as J2EE and SOAP.<br>
Most development can be done in the application layer by reading and setting 
bean properties and exercising business services. The simple API in combination 
with the flexible configuration helps maintain good separation between the 
model, view and controller components.
<h2>Struts Differences</h2>
There are numerous feature-based comparisons to be made with Struts, the most 
popular open-source framework for building J2EE web applications.<br>
From a framework design point of view, there are several key differences:
<ul>
<li>Frame2 abstracts the J2EE API and HTTP protocol away from the user-provided 
application code. Developers do not need detailed knowledge of either to be 
productive in the environment.</li>
<li>Frame2 more naturally models the interaction between the user interface or 
client and the server elements. Struts treats this as a procedure call, where 
the request data is an argument to a requested action. Frame2 unifies the 
request intent and data into an event which is sequentially processed by event 
handlers. This model is more common to user-oriented applications and more 
flexible with respect to developing and configuring reusable application 
components.</li>
<li>Frame2 minimizes the amount of wrapping of existing standard Java APIs. 
For example, no wrapping is provided for message formatting and resource bundle 
management is limited to what is necessary for the framework.</li>
<li>Frame2 places more emphasis on flexibility in the configuration of the 
application. Users have more options for setting application strategies through 
the configuration, and more options for organizing their application logic to be 
reused both within the web application and across applications.</li>
<li>Frame2 supports co-hosting both web applications and web services with reuse 
of data and logic components between the two. The web applications are supported 
through a traditional J2EE Model 2 architecture with a configurable controller. 
The web services are supported through interoperability of the same controller 
with SOAP front-ends such as Apache Axis or the Sun implementation of 
JAX-RPC.</li>
<li>Frame2 places more emphasis on using emerging technologies such as the 
JSTL/EL and JAXB. As such, it lacks compatibility with older developer kits and 
J2EE specifications; however, it takes advantage of technologies like the 
Expression Language (EL), which makes obsolete the elaborate and framework 
specific tag libraries provided by Struts.</li>
</ul>
The differences are all intended to simplify developing a web application by 
creating a simple but flexible API.
