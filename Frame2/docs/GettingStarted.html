<h1>Getting Started With Frame2</h1>
<h2>Preface</h2>
This document is intended to help developers become familiar with the Frame2
framework by creating a very simple application.<br>
This document assumes that you have downloaded the full binary distribution of
Frame2. You may build Frame2 from the source distribution as well. Acquiring the
full distribution is highly recommended as it includes all of the extra binaries
required to run a Frame2 application.<br><br>
This document also assumes knowledge of web applications and their directory
layouts. Information about web applications can be found at 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/webservices/docs/1.0/tutorial/doc/WebApp.html">Sun's Website</a>.
<br><br>
The example built during this tutorial is available as part of the Frame2
distribution. Read the instructions for how to build the <code>example</code>
web application under the <i>samples</i> directory.
<h2>Components of a Frame2 Application</h2>
A Frame2 application is made up of events, event handlers, view components, and 
configuration files.
<ul><li>Events - A Frame2 event is a Java object that implements the Frame2 
event interface. An event acts as a data container that passes data between the 
model and the view. The event must conform to JavaBean specifications for 
getters/setters in order to utilize the automatic data population of the event.
</li>
<li>Event Handlers - A Frame2 event handler is a Java class that implements the 
Frame2 handler interface. A handler is the controller class that allows data 
from the view to interact with the model, and allows data from the model to 
interact with the view.</li>
<li>Global Forwards - Global forward declarations represent views and events to 
go to when done handling an event. A view generally points to a JSP that can 
render in a browser. An event that forwards to another event is called 
event-chaining.</li>
<li>Deployment Descriptor - The deployment descriptor, or web.xml file, contains 
the web application settings for the Frame2 servlets, listeners and context 
parameters. The servlet-mapping section of the web-app defines how events with 
a '.f2' extension are directed to the HTTP Controller servlet.</li>
<li>Configuration File - The Frame2 configuration file is the glue that ties the 
application together. The configuration file declaratively defines events, 
event-mappings, and views.</li></ul>
<h2>The Example Application</h2>
The example application that we will be building is a very simple application 
that lets users be added and viewed. Templates will not be used for this example.<br>
<h3>Example Application Features</h3>
The example application demonstrates many of the features of the Frame2 
framework. Keep these in mind as we build the application.
The features include:
<ul><li>Pass-thru event processing - Allows an event request to forward directly 
to a view without defining an Event class or a Handler class.</li>
<li>Event Error handling - Demonstrates how the framework automatically 
validates the event and the error tag support.</li>
<li>Event chaining - Demonstrates how the framework handles a request event, 
and via configuration, the response event is then chained to and executed.</li>
<li>Frame2 JSP tags - Used throughout the supplied JSPs.</li>
<li>Resource Message Bundle - Resource keys are used for errors raised.</li>
<li>Basic validation - Use of custom data validation.</li>
<li>Commons Validation - Use of automatic validations for a variety of conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Building the Example</h2>
The following sections will show how to build the example application. The 
source code files described need to be created within the directory structure 
per the package definition.  Compile the Java classes any way you like.  Once 
compiled, place them in the <i>/WEB-INF/classes</i> directory so they can be 
found by the application.
<h3>Build the blank Frame2 Application</h3>
Follow the instructions given in the <i>samples</i> directory of the Frame2 
distribution to build the blank WAR file, which is a great starting place for
building Frame2 applications. Expand the WAR file so that files can be added and
edited.
<h4>Examine the web.xml file</h4>
Open the <i>web.xml</i> file to see how Frame2 works as a web application. Pay 
attention to the context parameters; Frame2 has many settings that can be 
overridden using this method.
<h4>Examine the Frame2 Configuration File</h4>
Open the <i>frame2-config.xml</i> file, found in the <i>WEB-INF</i> directory. 
The configuration file included with the blank application has placeholders for
the various elements. We will examine these in more detail during this tutorial.
<h3>Displaying Current Users</h3>
We will begin by creating the necessary files to view current users in our 
example application. This will require creating an event to temporarily hold the
list of users, an event handler to retrieve the user list and place it into the
event, a JSP to display the list of users, and a simple object to hold users.
<h4>Display Users Event</h4>
The Display Users event will simply hold the list of users so that the Frame2 
tags can iterate over the list and display all users.<br>
Create a new class named <code>DisplayUsers</code> that extends the 
<code>org.megatome.frame2.event.CommonsValidatorEvent</code> class. You may select
any package you wish - for this example all files were created in the 
<code>org.megatome.example</code> package.<br>
Add a field to the class of type <code>List</code> that is named <code>users</code>. 
Add a getter and setter for the field. The class should resemble the following:<br>
<pre>
package org.megatome.example;

import java.util.List;

import org.megatome.frame2.event.CommonsValidatorEvent;

public class DisplayUsers extends CommonsValidatorEvent {
   private List users;
	
   public List getUsers() { return users; }
	
   public void setUsers(List users) { this.users = users; }
}
</pre>
<h4>Frame2 Configuration</h4>
In order for Frame2 to know about the event, it must be added to the configuration
file. Add the following entry to <i>frame2-config.xml</i> (colored text is the 
text to add)<br>
<pre>&lt;events&gt;
<font color="red">&lt;event name="displayUsers" type="org.megatome.example.DisplayUsers"/&gt;</font>
&lt;/events&gt;</pre>
<h4>User Object</h4>
Create a new class named <code>User</code>. This class needs no superclass. We're
going to keep this class simple, so add <code>String</code> fields for 
<code>userName</code> and <code>email</code>, plus their associated getters 
and setters.<br>
The class should resemble the following:<br>
<pre>
package org.megatome.example;

public class User {
   private String userName;
   private String email;
	
   public String getEmail() { return email; }
	
   public void setEmail(String email) { this.email = email; }
	
   public String getUserName() { return userName; }
	
   public void setUserName(String userName) { this.userName = userName;	}
}
</pre>
<h4>User Storage</h4>
We will be using a simple static object to hold the user list. Create a class
named <code>UserStorage</code> that has no superclass. This class should contain 
a <code>List</code> for storage of <code>User</code> objects, an <code>addUser()</code> 
method, and a <code>getUsers()</code> method, all declared static.<br>
The class should resemble the following:<br>
<pre>
package org.megatome.example;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class UserStorage {
   private static List users = new ArrayList();
	
   public static void addUser(User user) { users.add(user); }
	
   public static List getUsers() { return users; }
}
</pre>
This is a very basic implementation - notice that we have no methods for removing
users, changing users, or even detecting duplicate users. These features can be
added to this project if desired, and would be a great way to become more familiar
with Frame2.
<h4>Display Users Event Handler</h4>
This event handler is responsible for getting the list of users from the storage
object and populating the event with them.<br>
Create a new class called <code>DisplayUsersHandler</code> that implements 
the <code>org.megatome.frame2.event.EventHandler</code> interface. Implement the 
required <code>handle()</code> method with the following code:<br>
<pre>
public String handle(Event event, Context context) throws Exception {
	DisplayUsers myEvent = (DisplayUsers)event;
		
	List users = UserStorage.getUsers();
	myEvent.setUsers(users);
	return null;
}
</pre>
<h4>Edit Frame2 Configuration</h4>
The handler must be added to the Frame2 configuration. Add the following entry
to <i>frame2-config.xml</i> (colored text is the text to be added):<br>
<pre>&lt;event-handlers&gt;
<font color="red">&lt;event-handler name="displayUsersHandler" type="org.megatome.example.DisplayUsersHandler"/&gt;</font>
&lt;/event-handlers&gt;</pre>
<h4>Display Users JSP</h4>
We will now create the JSP used to display the list of users. We will use a mixture
of JSTL tags and Frame2 custom tags to display the information.<br>
In the root of the web application, create a file named <i>displayUsers.jsp</i>. 
Copy the following code into it:<br>
<pre>
&lt;%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html" %&gt;
&lt;%@ taglib uri="taglib.tld" prefix="frame2" %&gt;
&lt;%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jstl/core" prefix="c" %&gt;

&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;All Users&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;c:choose&gt;
  &lt;c:when test="${!empty displayUsers.users}"&gt;
    &lt;TABLE width=75%&gt;
  	&lt;TH align="left" width=15%&gt;User Name&lt;/TH&gt;
    &lt;TH align="left" width=20%&gt;Email Address&lt;/TH&gt;
  	&lt;c:forEach items="${displayUsers.users}" var="nextUser"&gt;
  	&lt;tr&gt;
  	&lt;td&gt;&lt;c:out value="${nextUser.userName}"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  	&lt;td&gt;&lt;c:out value="${nextUser.email}"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  	&lt;/tr&gt;
  	&lt;/c:forEach&gt;
    &lt;/TABLE&gt;	
  &lt;/c:when&gt;
  &lt;c:otherwise&gt;
  There are no users defined
  &lt;/c:otherwise&gt;
&lt;/c:choose&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre>
This JSP simply uses the JSTL to iterate through each user in the event and 
list the user's name and email in a table. If there are no defined users, a
message is printed to that effect.<br>
This page will be forwarded to as a result of calling the display users event,
so it must be added to the Frame2 configuration as a view. Add the following entry
to <i>frame2-config.xml</i> (colored text is the text to be added):<br>
<pre>&lt;global-forwards&gt;
<font color="red">&lt;forward name="displayUsersJSP" type="HTMLResource" path="/displayUsers.jsp"/&gt;</font>
&lt;/global-forwards&gt;</pre>
This entry tells Frame2 that the forward named "displayUsersJSP" is a resource
that can be forwarded to like normal HTML/JSP resources. Other types of forwards
include XML responders, XML resources, and direct event forwards.
<h4>Event mapping</h4>
Now that we have an event, event handler, and a global forward defined, it's time
to tie them all together with what's known as an event mapping. Event mappings
define what events are used with event handlers, and can also specify views to
forward to on validation failure, user cancellation, and normal execution of all
handlers in the mapping.<br>
Add the following entry to <i>frame2-config.xml</i> (colored text is the text to be 
added):<br>
<pre>&lt;event-mappings&gt;<font color="red">
&lt;event-mapping eventName="displayUsers"&gt;
  &lt;handler name="displayUsersHandler"/&gt;
  &lt;view type="HTML" forwardName="displayUsersJSP"/&gt;
&lt;/event-mapping&gt;</font>
&lt;/event-mappings&gt;
</pre>
This mapping tells Frame2 how to act when an event named "displayUsers" is called.
Events may be called either through a link (<code>&lt;a href="displayUsers.f2"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;</code>),
or as an action from a form (<code>&lt;form action="displayUsers.f2"&gt;</code>). 
When the "displayUsers" event is called, Frame2 creates an instance of the 
<code>DisplayUsers</code> event and passes it to an instance of the 
<code>DisplayUsersHandler</code> handler. The handler may return a string from 
its <code>handle()</code> method; if this happens, Frame2 will forward to the 
view named by the returned string. If the <code>handle()</code> method returns 
null, Frame2 will forward to the view named in the event mapping.<br>
In this case, clicking a link with href "<code>displayUsers.f2</code>" will 
result in the handler getting the list of users and placing that list in the 
event before forwarding to the JSP we defined to list all of the users.
<h4>Index page</h4>
We're almost ready to test. We just need to create a simple index page with a
link to the display users event. Create a file called <i>index.html</i> at the 
web application root, and copy the following into it:<br>
<pre>&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Index&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;a href="displayUsers.f2"&gt;Display Users&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre>
<h4>Run the Application</h4>
We now should have a fully working, if limited functionality, web application.
Load the web application into a servlet container, and run the application. You
should get an initial page with a link, and another page saying that there are
no users once the link is clicked.
<h3>Adding users</h3>
Obviously, this application is of no use of there's no way to get users into the
system. To accomplish this, we'll need one more event, one more event handler, 
one more JSP, and several edits to the Frame2 configuration.
<h4>Add User Event</h4>
We could create a new event to capture a user's data entered into a form, but we
already have a <code>User</code> class that contains the appropriate information. 
We'll just modify it to be a Frame2 event and avoid having to create new code.<br>
Change the signature of the <code>User</code> class so that it extends 
<code>org.megatome.frame2.event.CommonsValidatorEvent</code>. 
Add a new event entry to the Frame2 configuration like the following:<br>
<pre>&lt;event name="addUser" type="org.megatome.example.User"/&gt;</pre>
<h4>Add User Handler</h4>
Create a new class named <code>AddUserHandler</code> that implements the 
<code>org.megatome.frame2.event.EventHandler</code> interface. Implement the 
required <code>handle()</code> method with the following code:<br>
<pre>
public String handle(Event event, Context context) throws Exception {
	User user = (User)event;
		
	UserStorage.addUser(user);
	return null;
}
</pre>
The <code>User</code> event will be automatically updated with the form data by 
the framework, so we can add it directly to the user storage.<br>
Add a new event handler entry to the Frame2 configuration:<br>
<pre>&lt;event-handler name="addUserHandler" type="org.megatome.example.AddUserHandler"/&gt;</pre>
<h4>Add User JSP</h4>
Create a file named <i>addUser.jsp</i> and copy the following code into it:<br>
<pre>
&lt;%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html" %&gt;
&lt;%@ taglib uri="taglib.tld" prefix="frame2" %&gt;

&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Add New User&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;frame2:form action="addUser.f2" method="POST"&gt;
&lt;table border="0"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;User Name:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;frame2:text name="name"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;Email:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;frame2:text name="email"/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;frame2:submit/&gt;&lt;frame2:reset/&gt;
&lt;/frame2:form&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre>
This JSP uses some of the Frame2 form processing custom tags. Note how the name
of each text tag is specified so that the setters may be properly called. (e.g.,
the <code>name="email"</code> tells Frame2 to try to call <code>setEmail()</code> 
in the event).<br>
We will not add a global forward for this JSP yet, but we'll need to later when
we perform some simple validation.
<h4>Modify Display User JSP</h4>
Add a new link below the <code>&lt;/c:choose&gt;</code> tag in the <i>displayUsers.jsp</i>
file similar to:<br>
<pre>&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="addUser.jsp"&gt;Add New User:&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
Now we just need to map everything together!
<h4>Add User Event Mapping</h4>
Since we are not performing any validation yet, this event mapping will fairly
simple. We want to tie the User event to the <code>AddUserHandler</code> handler, 
and forward to the <code>DisplayUsers</code> event when we are finished. In 
order to forward to an event, we will first need to create a new global forward 
that points to the desired event:<br>
<pre>&lt;forward name="displayUsersForward" type="event" path="displayUsers"/&gt;</pre>
Now we can add our event mapping:<br>
<pre>
&lt;event-mapping eventName="addUser"&gt;
  &lt;handler name="addUserHandler"/&gt;
  &lt;view type="HTML" forwardName="displayUsersForward"/&gt;
&lt;/event-mapping&gt;
</pre>
<h4>Run the Application</h4>
Run the web application as before. There should now be a link from the display
users page to the add user page. Enter any name and email address, and select the
"Submit" button. The newly entered username and email address are shown.
<h3>Cancelling an Operation</h3>
Currently, there is no friendly way to cancel the user add operation. A user may
use the back button in the browser to return to the display page, but an explicit
operation works better.<br>
Implementing a cancel operation in Frame2 is simple. The framework provides a
cancel tag to be used in JSPs, and the event mapping needs a very small tweak.
<h4>Change the Add User JSP</h4>
In the add user JSP, add the following tag immediately after the reset tag:<br>
<pre>&lt;frame2:cancel/&gt;</pre>
<h4>Update the event mapping</h4>
Event mappings have an attribute called "cancelView". This attribute tells the
framework which view to forward to in the case of a cancel event. Add the following
to the add user event mapping, right after the "eventName" attribute:<br>
<pre>cancelView="displayUsersForward"</pre>
<h4>Run the application</h4>
Run the application, verifying that the add user JSP now has a Cancel button. 
Verify that selecting the Cancel button returns to the display users page.
<h3>Basic Validation</h3>
We'll add some very basic validation now. All we will check for at this point is
that both fields are non-empty when a user submits the form.
<h4>Create the error messages</h4>
We need to create a file to hold the error messages that will be displayed.
Create a new file named <i>frame2-app-bundle.properties</i> in a location that 
will make sure it is in the classpath when the application is run. For this 
example, this file will be placed at the root of the source tree. In order for 
the properties file to be in the classpath, it will need to be in the 
<i>WEB-INF/classes</i> folder when deployed. (Many IDEs will copy resource files 
automatically to the correct location.)<br>
Note that the file name is the one specified in <i>web.xml</i> as a context parameter.<br>
Add the following lines to the new file:<br>
<pre>
org.megatome.frame2.taglib.errors.prefix=&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;
org.megatome.frame2.taglib.errors.suffix=&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
username.required=Username is required.
email.required=Email address is required.
</pre>
The first two lines tell Frame2 how to display errors. In this case, we want each
error to be displayed in red, bold text with a line break after each one.
<h4>Update User Event</h4>
We need to update the user event so that validation occurs. Add the following
method to the user event:<br>
<pre>
public boolean validate(Errors errors) {
   if ((userName == null) || userName.equals("")) {
      errors.add("username.required");
   }
       
   if ((email == null) || email.equals("")) {
      errors.add("email.required");
   }
   return errors.isEmpty();
}
</pre>
We are simply verifying that both fields contain some data - we don't care at this 
point what the data may be. The method returns true if the errors object is empty,
indicating that no validation problems occurred and the operation was a success.
<h4>Update Add User JSP</h4>
We need to add a tag to the add user JSP to display any errors that were generated
during the validation process. Add the following line to the add user JSP just
before the Frame2 <code>form</code> tag:<br>
<pre>&lt;frame2:errors/&gt;</pre>
We also want to make sure that any correct input doesn't get lost when showing
errors. To accomplish this, we need to populate the form fields with any 
existing data.<br>
Change this tag:
<pre>&lt;frame2:text name="userName"/&gt;</pre>
to this:
<pre>&lt;frame2:text name="userName" value="${addUser.userName}"/&gt;</pre>
Change this tag:
<pre>&lt;frame2:text name="email"/&gt;</pre>
to this:
<pre>&lt;frame2:text name="email" value="${addUser.email}"/&gt;</pre>
<h4>Update Frame2 Configuration</h4>
Once again, we must update the configuration file to inform Frame2 that we wish
to have validation enabled and where to forward to when validation fails. Add the
following to the add user event mapping after the "cancelView" attribute:<br>
<pre>inputView="addUserJSP" validate="true"</pre>
<h4>Run the application</h4>
Run the application once again, and see what happens when you leave one or more
of the form fields empty.
<h3>Commons Validation</h3>
To enable Commons validation, we will need to follow several steps. The rules and
mappings for validation must be added to the web application and modified, the 
validator plugin must be enabled, and the User event needs to be modified.
<h4>Copy Rules and Mappings</h4>
You will need to copy some files from the source distribution of Frame2 into 
your example web application. Copy the <i>commonsvalidator</i> folder and its 
contents from the <i>framework/test/src/WEB-INF<i> folder in the source 
distribution. There will be two files in this folder: <i>commons-validator-rules.xml</i> 
and <i>commons-validation-mappings.xml</i>. We will need to modify the mappings 
file to instruct the Commons Validator how to validate our form.<br>
In order for error messages produced by the Commons validator to be properly
shown, we need to add them to the application's resource file. Copy the entries
found at the top of the rules file into the <i>frame2-app-bundle.properties</i> 
file. The messages should resemble the following:<br>
<pre>
# Commons Validator Error Messages
errors.required={0} is required.
errors.minLength={0} can not be less than {1} characters.
errors.maxLength={0} can not be greater than {1} characters.

errors.byte={0} must be a byte.
errors.short={0} must be a short.
errors.integer={0} must be an integer.
errors.long={0} must be a long.
errors.float={0} must be a float.
errors.double={0} must be a double.

errors.date={0} is not a date.
errors.intRange={0} is not in the range {1} through {2}.
errors.floatRange={0} is not in the range {1} through {2}.
errors.doubleRange={0} is not in the range {1} through {2}.
errors.creditCard={0} is an invalid credit card number.
errors.email={0} is an invalid e-mail address.
errors.mask={0} is invalid.
errors.twofields={0} must have the same value as {1}.
</pre>
<h4>Modify Validator Mappings</h4>
We must add the appropriate information about our event to the mappings file in
order for the Commons Validator to properly validate the data.<br>
We want the username and email address to be required, and we want the email 
address to be in a valid format. Add the following lines to the <i>commons-validation-mappings.xml</i>
file, between the <code>form-validation</code> elements:<br>
<pre>
&lt;formset&gt;
   &lt;form name="addUser"&gt;
      &lt;field property="userName" depends="required"&gt;
         &lt;arg0 key="userName"/&gt;
      &lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;field property="email" depends="required,email"&gt;
         &lt;arg0 key="email"/&gt;
      &lt;/field&gt;
   &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/formset&gt;
</pre>
Since the validator relies on placing field names with standard messages, the
error messages we added to the application properties file earlier will not work.
Replace the lines:<br>
<pre>
username.required=Username is required.
email.required=Email address is required.
</pre>
with the lines:<br>
<pre>
userName=Username
email=Email Address
</pre>
<h4>Enable Commons Validator Plugin</h4>
Remove the comment around the plugin in the Frame2 configuration file.
<h4>Modify User Event</h4>
The Commons Validation event, from which our User event is derived, supports
using the Commons validator automatically. There are two ways to use this validation:
<ol><li>Remove the overridden <code>validate()</code> method. This will use the 
Commons Validator exclusively.</li>
<li>Call <code>super.validate()</code> from our overridden <code>validate()</code> 
method. This is useful if extra validation (e.g. checking for duplicates) needs 
to be performed after the data is initially checked.</li></ol>
For the purposes of this example, using only the Commons Validator is sufficient.
Remove the overridden <code>validate()</code> method from the User event.
<h4>Run the Application</h4>
Run the application again, verifying that username and email are still required, 
and that a valid email address is now required.
