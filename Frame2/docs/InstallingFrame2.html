<h1>Installing and Configuring Frame2 Distributions</h1>
This guide explains the steps for installing and configuring the Frame2 
distributions. Frame2 is an open-source J2EE servlet framework for creating web 
applications and web services. More information can be found at: 
<a href="http://frame2.sourceforge.net">http://frame2.sourceforge.net</a>.<br>
At this website you can also download the distribution of 
the framework. The available distribution includes both binary and source files. Binary files include the pre-compiled framework 
java archives and API documentation and is intended for users who are going to 
use Frame2 to build an application or service. The source files includes 
all source code and scripts needed to build and test the framework. It is 
intended for developers who wish to extend or modify the framework and for 
users who want a better understanding of the framework's implementation.

*: Only the blankwar example is included in the binary distribution.<br><br>
The framework subproject also contains the DTD files for the Frame2 and template 
configuration files.<br>
The source distribution may be used in-place once it is extracted from the distribution 
package. There are no special requirements for placement of the distribution. As 
is, the distribution assumes that third-party tools are installed and configured 
on the development platform.
<h2>Tools used by Frame2</h2>
Tools used by distribution are as follows:<br>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Tool</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>ant</td><td>The distribution uses ant for its build system. See the 
release notes for the currently-used version. Ant may be downloaded from 
<a href="http://ant.apache.org">http://ant.apache.org</a>. To execute all 
elements of the build, the normal ant distribution will need to be augmented 
with packages from the other third-party packages. Where this is necessary the 
third-party packages listed below will indicate the dependency. The simplest 
approach is to copy the associated jar file into the ant lib directory.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tomcat</td><td>The distribution was built using Tomcat for manual and in-container 
unit testing, although any servlet container that supports the servlet 2.3 
specification and the JSP 1.2 specification should work. Tomcat may be downloaded 
from <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/</a>. 
No special server or common packages are needed for the Tomcat installation.</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Third-party Libraries</h2>
The Frame2 distributions have two types of library dependencies. The first are 
needed for using the framework, the second are needed for building and testing 
the framework.
<h3>Libraries for Using the Framework</h3>
The Frame2 framework leverages the J2EE specification to minimize its 
dependencies on third-party libraries when deployed. More detail is given in the 
Getting Started Guide, but a brief outline is:
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Library</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>JSTL/EL</td><td>The framework uses the reference implementation of the 
Java Standard Template Library as provided by Sun and the Apache Software 
Foundation. The use is primarily of the Expression Language (EL).
This implementation is available with the standard.jar, available from 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/jstl">http://java.sun.com/jstl</a>. 
It is recommended the full JSTL be use for JSP development; the framework tag 
libraries are intended to complement the JSTL tags.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>JAXB</td><td>The implementation of the web service framework assumes 
that all SOAP message bodies may be marshalled and unmarshalled using the JAXB 
API and implementation. As such, users that wish to use Frame2 for implementing 
their web services will need to use JAXB to generate their event classes as well 
as provide JAXB to the service runtime. JAXB is available as part of the Java 6.
JAXB can also be used to generate event classes for the web application portion 
of the framework.</td></tr>
<tr><td>log4j (optional)</td><td>The user may choose to use the pre-built 
binding between the internal logging used by the framework code and log4j. 
Log4j may be downloaded at <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j">http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j</a>.
Log4j is not required to use the framework. By default the framework will use 
logging based on the java.util.logging package.</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Libraries for Developing the Framework</h3>
The Frame2 baseline uses numerous open-source packages for its build and test 
environment.
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Package</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Apache AXIS</td><td>The test and example applications both use the Apache 
AXIS SOAP. There is no Axis-depended code within the applications; however the web 
application is configured through the deployment descriptors to use Axis. Axis 
is available at <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis">http://ws.apache.org/axis</a>.
</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Test packages</h3>	
Test packages used in the baseline are:
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Package</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>junit</td><td>Most tests are based on the jUnit test framework. These 
tests may be executed as part of the build or singularly. jUnit may be 
downloaded from <a href="http://junit.org">http://junit.org</a>.<br>
The ant build system requires the jUnit jar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>strutstestcase</td><td>The strutstestcase contains a fairly complete set
of Servlet mock objects in the servletunit. These are used for a JUnit based test 
class provided in the distribution, MockFrame2TestCase. Strutstestcase may be 
downloaded from	<a href="http://strutstestcase.sourceforge.net">http://strutstestcase.sourceforge.net</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>cactus</td><td>The Cactus test framework is an extension of jUnit for 
in-container testing. Cactus is available from <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus">http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus</a>.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>tagunit</td><td>The test_app subproject contains a full complement of 
tag library tests based on the tagunit extension to jUnit. Tagunit may be 
downloaded at <a href="http://tagunit.org">http://tagunit.org</a>.
The ant build system requires the tagunit ant task jar.</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Configuring the Distribution to use the Third-Party Resources</h2>
The source distribution may be configured to point to the location of the 
third-party packages. The mechanism to do so is provided through the env.properties 
and override.properties files in the base directories. The env.properties 
specifies the relative locations of the third-party packages as configured in 
the baseline. Each entry may be overridden by pre-declaring it in the 
override.properties file (create one as necessary). For example, to specify the 
Tomcat location for the build make an entry in the override.properties, such as:
<pre>tomcat-home    c:/tomcat_5.0</pre>
By pre-declaring entries in the override file they will take precedence over the 
configured values. The values in the env.properties reflect the structure of the 
configured baseline.
<h2>Building and Testing the Distribution</h2>
Once the third-party packages have been installed and the override.properties 
has been written to use them, the build system may be run to build the framework, 
the test code, and run the tests. In general it is assumed the developer will 
work within an IDE for most development. The build system supports development 
in a more basic environment, for example, a shell and text editor, in that it 
allows the automated build and execution of individual tests.<br>
The primary purpose of the build system is to generate reference builds (that is, 
builds conforming to specific dependency rules), execute single and full 
regression tests, and to create deployments for the tests and the distributions.<br> 
The primary targets of the master build.xml are described in the following table. 
All derived elements are written into the output directory (specified by the 
local-out property).
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Target</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>all</td><td>Compiles all source code and unit tests, generates JavaDoc, and runs all unit tests</td></tr>
<tr><td>clean</td><td>Deletes the derived build elements.</td></tr>
<tr><td>compile</td><td>Compiles all source code</td></tr>
<tr><td>test</td><td>Compiles and runs all unit tests, special tests, and container 
tests. Via the junitreport ant task, a summary report of the test results will 
be written into the directory ${local-out}/test/reports/html.</td></tr>
<tr><td>unit_tests</td><td>Compiles and runs unit tests</td></tr>
<tr><td>special_tests</td><td>Compiles and runs special tests. (e.g. Tests requiring
different classpaths than normal unit tests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>test-one</td><td>Compile and run a single unit test. The test name is 
specified with the argument -DTEST_CASE=fully.qualified.class.Name</td></tr>
<tr><td>dist</td><td>Generates the Frame2 Java archive files</td></tr>
<tr><td>javadoc</td><td>Generates the user JavaDoc</td></tr>
<tr><td>container_tests</td><td>Run the container tests. Requires the 
run_container_tests property to be set. Currently requires that the WAR be built
and deployed to a running instance of Tomcat manually before running this target</td></tr>
<tr><td>war</td><td>Build a WAR file containing the test_app application.</td></tr>
<tr><td>tagunit_tests</td><td>Run the tagunit tests against the deployed WAR. Requires the 
run_container_tests property to be set. Currently requires that the WAR be built
and deployed to a running instance of Tomcat manually before running this target</td></tr>
<tr><td>cactus_tests</td><td>Run the Cactus tests against the deployed WAR. Requires the 
run_container_tests property to be set. Currently requires that the WAR be built
and deployed to a running instance of Tomcat manually before running this target</td></tr>
<tr>
  <td>build_image</td>
  <td>Creates the distribution image</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
All tests are identified by being configured under a test subproject's source 
directory and beginning with the characters 'Test'.<br>
It is required that Tomcat be running with versions of the test web applications 
loaded prior to running the full regression tests.
