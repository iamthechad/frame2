I didn't maintain a list of changes before 1.3, changes to any version prior to 1.3 are not captured here.

Changes in 1.3.1:
---------------------
* Support setting enum values in events. Frame2 uses the Enum.valueOf() method to convert a String value into an enum instance. Getters and setters that use enum
values should get persisted through events and into views correctly.

Changes in 1.3:
--------------------
Major Updates
* Version 1.3 requires Java 6
* Removed dependencies on Java Web Services Developer Kit since JAXB support is now in Java 6
* Updated Frame2 DTD to allow specification of schemas for JAXB events. Schemas are used when validating the contents of a SOAP message.

Minor Changes
* Version 1.2 and earlier used two separate files for Commons Validation - a rules file and a mappings file. In 1.3, these files have been combined into a single file.

Features
* Added a way to pass event information to chained events without having to resort to something dodgy like sticking the information in the session.

Bug Fixes
* Don't crash when creating a SOAP fault and there are no matching properties for the error message.
* Properly validate all chained events, not just the first.
