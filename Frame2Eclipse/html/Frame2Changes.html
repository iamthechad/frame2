<body><h1>Frame2&nbsp;Changelog</h1>I didn't maintain a list of changes before 1.3, changes to any version prior to 1.3 are not captured here.<br><br><h2>Changes in 1.3.1:</h2><ul><li>Support setting enum values in events. Frame2 uses the Enum.valueOf() method to convert a String value into an enum instance. Getters and setters that use enum values should get persisted through events and into views correctly.</li><li>Allow input views to be events<br></li></ul><h2>Changes in 1.3:</h2><h3>Major Updates</h3><ul><li>Version 1.3 requires Java 6</li><li>Removed dependencies on Java Web Services Developer Kit since JAXB support is now in Java 6</li><li>Updated
Frame2 DTD to allow specification of schemas for JAXB events. Schemas
are used when validating the contents of a SOAP message.<br></li></ul><h3>Minor Changes</h3><ul><li>Version
1.2 and earlier used two separate files for Commons Validation - a
rules file and a mappings file. In 1.3, these files have been combined
into a single file.</li></ul><h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Added a way to
pass event information to chained events without having to resort to
something dodgy like sticking the information in the session.</li></ul><h3>Bug Fixes</h3><ul><li>Don't crash when creating a SOAP fault and there are no matching properties for the error message.</li><li>Properly validate all chained events, not just the first.<br></li></ul></body></html>
